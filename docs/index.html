Overview</h1>
<p><code>libmypaint</code>, a.k.a. "the brush library" or "brushlib", provides a set of structures and interfaces allowing applications to use MyPaint brushes to draw strokes on surfaces.</p>
<p>See the data structures list for a context-free overview of the functionality provided. The most relevant structures (with associated functions) are: </p><hr/>
<p><a class="el" href="structMyPaintSurface.html" title="Abstract surface type for the MyPaint brush engine. ">MyPaintSurface</a>, <a class="el" href="structMyPaintBrush.html" title="Maintains the data and state required to perform brush strokes. ">MyPaintBrush</a>, and <a class="el" href="structMyPaintTiledSurface.html" title="Tile-backed implementation of MyPaintSurface. ">MyPaintTiledSurface</a> </p><hr/>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qwe"></a>
Brief History</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is now <code>libmypaint</code> started out as a part of the <a href="https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/">MyPaint</a> drawing program. Over time the code was gradually separated from the rest of the application, and eventually split out into a separate library. This evolution from an origin in application-specific code, as opposed to a design intended to be used as an independent library, is the reason why a lot of the code is structured the way it is.</li>
</ul>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The focus of this timeline is development that relates to the parts of MyPaint development that ultimately became libmypaint. It is only a small fraction of the work that was undertaken over the covered time period.</dd></dl>
<ul>
<li><b>2004</b>: Martin Renold published the first iteration of MyPaint, a gtk-based minimal painting program. At first, the only adjustable brush parameters were radius, color (RGB) and opacity (erroneously named "opaque", which remains the canonical name to this day). Soon after, spacing and distance parameters were added as well.</li>
<li><b>2005</b>: First implementation of the infinite surface, parts of which eventually turned into <a class="el" href="structMyPaintTiledSurface.html" title="Tile-backed implementation of MyPaintSurface. ">MyPaintTiledSurface</a>. The brush code was reworked, turning the color into setting values (and switching those values from RGB to HSV). Apart from the color components, 20 new settings were implemented (most of which remain today).</li>
<li><b>2006</b>: The <code>custom</code> setting &amp; input were added, as well as <code>speed_log</code>, <code>speed_sqrt</code> and <code>opaque_linearize</code>. The <code>color_saturation</code> setting was removed.</li>
<li><b>2007</b>: Color transformation settings were added, as well as <code>smudge_length</code> and <code>tracking_noise</code>.</li>
<li><b>2008</b>: The <code>eraser</code> setting was added. At the end of 2008, the core drawing code was split off into the "brushlib". Moved a lot of code from C to C++.</li>
<li><b>2009</b>: Dab angle and ratio settings were added, as well as direction filter.</li>
<li><b>2010</b>: The <code>smudge_radius_log</code> setting was added, as well as the <code>tilt_declination</code> and <code>tilt_ascension</code> inputs.</li>
<li><b>2011</b>: The <code>lock_alpha</code> and <code>colorize</code> settings were added.</li>
<li><b>2012</b>: Initial split to <code>libmypaint</code>, with general dependency cleanup. The brushlib was converted (back) to C, from C++.</li>
<li><b>2013-2015</b>: A lot of maintenance work and general improvements, preparing for independent releases and usage of the library.</li>
<li><b>2016</b>: First release of libmypaint, which for unspecified reasons was assigned the version <code>1.3.0</code>. <dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The version was almost certainly chosen because of the next minor version of MyPaint, which was assumed to be the first release using libmypaint as an external dependency.</dd></dl>
</li>
<li><b>2017-2019</b>: Gridmap settings and inputs were added, as well as many kinds of dab offsets. Spectral blending was introduced, as well as additional stroke parameters that let the engine be aware of canvas rotation and zoom when calculating angles and speed values. <br />
<br />
 libmypaint <code>1.4.0</code> was released, not including the new features.</li>
<li><b>2020</b>: The new features were backported in an API-compatible way, and <code>1.5.0</code> was released.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Examples"></a>
Examples</h1>
<p>There is a minimal example in the <code>examples</code> folder, but for now the best way to learn the structure is to look at how the functions and structures are used by the MyPaint code. </p>
